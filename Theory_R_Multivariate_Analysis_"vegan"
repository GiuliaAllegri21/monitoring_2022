# MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS 

# how to deal with the space? 
# we have to imagine to have a certain area and we go on the field. --> on the specific plots !
# in Situ-Data collection --> number of observations of different species, in each plot 
# The obervation can be ploted together to see if they have an interaction inside the site of study --> and thid is a Multivariate Analysis
  # we have no possibility to see the third dimension and we can reduce in 2 dimension the 3rd one. 
 
 Dimensionality ? 
 
 Principal Component --> summarize the information content in large data tables,
 by means of a smaller set of “summary indices” that can be more easily visualized and analyzed.

# used for recalling dataset, is a library of datasets
data(meuse)
# meuse is used for recalling the datasets 
head(meuse) # possible to take a look in meuse --> relationships between variables
summary(meuse) 
# summary gives me the possibility to analyze our data, min max, quantile etc...
# changing color using col=""
plot(cadmium, zinc, col="red")
# to get bigger size of dots in the graph using the function cex=""
plot(cadmium, zinc, col="red", cex="2") --> doubled size
pairs(meuse) --> used for having all the plots of data in one image
# changing colors of pairs
pairs(meuse, col="blue")

Plotting only few variables:

# cadmium copwe lead zinc
# pairs with soil variables
# from column 3 to column 6 

3:6 
pairs(meuse[, 3:6]) --> to select only the columns of interest
# in the coding language the "starting point" is always a comma ","
just to see the data of columns --> 
meuse[, 3:6]

to renaming selceted columns/datasets 
in this case : "POL"
pol <- meuse[,3:6]
pol 
# to show only some raws of our data and columns 
head(pol)
# it shows only few lines

# to make paris only of few data related to pollution (cadmium, lead, zinc)
pairs(pol, col="blue", cex=1.5)

# if we want to pair some data random and not a dataset 
cadmium + copper + lead + zinc, data=meuse
# using "thilde" for grouping things together is EQUAL (not =) but is written like thilde and in yellow color
# mac users alt+5

pairs(~cadmium + copper + lead + zinc, data=meuse, col="yellow")

pairs(~cadmium + copper + lead + zinc, data=meuse, col="magenta", cex=3) --> for changing the size of dots

# we want to have the coordinates of our dataset
using library(sp) we are able to have some coordinates
data(meuse)
head(meuse)
pol(meuse)

# using function "coordinates"
coordinates(meuse)= ~x+y 
# using tilde for starting from some point 

# now plotting every varuable in space, first to write always the dataset 
# "main" means the Title of the Plot 

ssplot(meuse, "zinc", main="Concentration of zinc")

# relationship between several variables --> this is called an array!
# c used for creating an array and having many plots

spplot(meuse, c("zinc", "copper"))
spplot(meuse, c("zinc", "copper","lead"))

# and the graph will show different plots in the same image
# rather than using colours, let's make us of bubbles -> the bubble increase according the the increase of data and concentration

bubble(meuse, "zinc")
bubble(meuse, "zinc", col="blue")

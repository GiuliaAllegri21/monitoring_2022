# download from virtuale the datasets ("Biomes multivariate datasets")
# to upload our project we use the following function using quotes cus are outside R 

load("biomes_multivar.RData")
 # sing "ls" function (we can se the tiles of our datasets, our list)

ls()

head(biomes)

# decorana --> it is able to take variables with different ranges and we have to name it --> "multivar", due to the fact that we are doing a multivariate analysis 

multivar <- decorana(biomes)
multivar 

# it explains the interactions of the analysis that we have. 
# we want to plot these multivariate datasets and analysis that we have simplified, obtained by the function "decorana"

plot(multivar)

using "ordiellipse" we can create ellipses for understanding the dimensions inside our multivar.datasets,analysis

ordiellipse(multivar, type, col=c("black","red","green","blue"), kind = "ehull", lwd=3)
ordispider(multiva, type, col=c("black", "red", "green", "blue"), label=T) 

# ultima funzione posso vedere quale tipo di bioma rappresenta ogni ellisse

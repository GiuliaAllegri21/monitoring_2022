# Let's plot for remote sensing in R 
# We were talking about colors and waves lenghts. 
# The "colors" that are we seeing is not what we directly see but what the surface reflects 
# There are many wavelenghts that we cannot see, which are the near infrared, x-ray, microwave, radiowave (which are dangerous)
# We use images from the satelite "Landsat", a projects started in 1972 which can provide extremely good satelite images of the ground 

# Import our downloaded data from lab22
# starting with remote sensing 

# brick used for importing all the layers o our datasets one obove the other in pixels 

p224r63_2011 <- brick("p224r63_2011_masked.grd")
p224r63_2011
plot(p224r63_2011)

cl <- colorRampPalette(c("dark blue", "blue", "light blue"))(100)
plot(p224r63_2011, col=cl)

# if the images doesn't pup after plotting, just write "dev.off()" for restarting all

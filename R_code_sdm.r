 # SDM
 ## R code for species distribution modelling, namely the distribution of individuals of a population in space

 install.packages("sdm")

 library(sdm)
 library(raster) #predictors
 library(rgdal) #species

 #Set the working directory 
 #setwd("/Users/Zuli/Desktop/lab/")

 # Now use the system file function in R that showing all the files in a certain packages
 #https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/system.file
 file <- system.file("external/species.shp", package="sdm")
 file #path in which you have the data

 # Let's plot the species data
 # re-creating a shape file in R with the shape file function 
 # https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/raster/versions/3.5-9/topics/shapefile that read or write a shapefile
 # shapefile = points in space --> coordinates for the species so the presence of absence of species 

 species <- shapefile(file) #exactly as the raster function for raster files

 # plot species

 plot(species, pch=19, col="red")
 # pch argument in r
 # points scattered in space

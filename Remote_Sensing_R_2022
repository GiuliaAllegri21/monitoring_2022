# Let's plot for remote sensing in R 
# We were talking about colors and waves lenghts. 
# The "colors" that are we seeing is not what we directly see but what the surface reflects 
# There are many wavelenghts that we cannot see, which are the near infrared, x-ray, microwave, radiowave (which are dangerous)
# We use images from the satelite "Landsat", a projects started in 1972 which can provide extremely good satelite images of the ground 

# Import our downloaded data from lab22
# starting with remote sensing 

# brick used for importing all the layers o our datasets one obove the other in pixels 

p224r63_2011 <- brick("p224r63_2011_masked.grd")
p224r63_2011
plot(p224r63_2011)

cl <- colorRampPalette(c("dark blue", "blue", "light blue"))(100)
plot(p224r63_2011, col=cl)

# if the images doesn't pup after plotting, just write "dev.off()" for restarting all

# plotting 4 different images with characteristics that we want in MULTIFRAME (same page) using-->  (par(mfrow=c(2,2)

par(mfrow=c(2,2))
clb <- colorRampPalette(c('dark blue','blue','light blue'))(100) # 
plot(p224r63_2011,[[1]], col=clb)

clg <- colorRampPalette(c('dark green','green','light green'))(100) # 
plot( p224r63_2011,[[2]], col=clg)

clr <- colorRampPalette(c('dark red','red','pink'))(100) # 
plot(p224r63_2011,[[3]], col=clr)

# Exercise: plot the final band, namely the NIR, band number 4
# darkorange, ywllo, coral

clcor <- colorRampPalette(c('Daekorange','yellow','coral'))(100) # 
plot(p224r63_2011,[[4]], col=clcor)

# we are going to have bands all together as a layer of images --> called MULTILAYER IMAGES

# first of all --> using image with NATURAL COLORS  
# "RGB" COLOR SCHEME IN R 


# multilayer colours --> RGB (red, green, blue)
# additional we sould insert "stretch" argument which is necessary for seeing better our layers, in our case is "Lin". It depends on what we are going to plot

# dev.off()
plotRGB(p224r63_2011, r=3, g=2, b=1, stretch="Lin") --> only with this is difficult to see differents btw water and ground 

plotRGB(p224r63_2011, r=4, g=3, b=2, stretch="Lin")

plotRGB(p224r63_2011, r=3, g=4, b=2, stretch="Lin")

plotRGB(p224r63_2011, r=3, g=2, b=4, stretch="Lin")

# we have a light reflection which gives us the perception of "colors", but is what the object is 
reflecting and not absorbing. S o using different bands for one to another we can see all the differencies in our satelite image
# Near Infrared is reflected by almost everything. And area with no vegetation doesn't refelct anything at all

# EXCERCISE plot the previous in same manner in a single multiframe


# in satelite analysis everytime we see theresholds, there was or is --> human actions!

# STRECH argument, is used for streching the original data in a new linear stretched  way  "Lin"
# HIST is another typpe of stretching --> for stretching a lot our color.
# EXAMPLE

par(mfrow=c(2,1)) # one above the other

plotRGB(p224r63_2011, r=4, g=3, b=2, stretch="Lin")
plotRGB(p224r63_2011, r=4, g=3, b=2, stretch="Hist")
